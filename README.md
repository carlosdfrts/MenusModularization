# MenusModularization
This Python script defines utility functions for a console interface, providing features such as creating styled headers, displaying colored menus, and validating integer input. These functions enhance the user interface in a console-based program, promoting readability with well-commented code. Additionally, the script serves as a practical exercise to practice the use of modules, packages, and functions.
